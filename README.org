#+title: tab-sets.el - Save and restore tab-bar tabs in Emacs
#+author: Grant Rosson
#+language: en

This package allows you to save the configuration of =tab-bar-mode= tabs
open in the current frame and restore that set of tabs later.

Saved tab sets persist between sessions, saved in =tab-sets-data-file=. (Set
this variable to a path before trying to save.)

To use with [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark]], add =(tab-sets-setup-embark)= to your init file.

* Installation

This package is not in a package archive, so it must be istalled directly.
